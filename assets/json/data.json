The southern one can be reached&nbsp;from the Church of the Eclipse site of grace by exiting&nbsp;through the church to the left, turning right outside, and heading up the ladder to the catwalks. After following the catwalk past the exile soldier and around the small tower, the Banished Knight can be found just past the ladder leading down. It is recommended that the player jump onto the lower roof next to the catwalk and tower, and bait the red-eyed Banished Knight into teleporting onto the small wooden catwalk extension of the roof; then the player can roll or jump to the walkway the Banished Knight was just standing on. The Banished Knight will slowly walk towards the player, then fall to its death onto the ground below, saving the player a good deal of trouble. Then the player walk down the walkway and make their way over to the loot, which will be in a corner, behind a tombstone. </li><li>  Dropped from&nbsp;all other&nbsp;Banished Knights.

From where you enter Limgrave, head Southeast and look for some stones you can use as steps to drop down without dying, they'll be close to the border of the lake. Cut around the bottom of the lake, avoiding the patrolling mercenary, and then cut Southeast across the field toward the road. You should see a the Agheel Lake South grace point on a little shelf below the road.&nbsp;From the grace, there are at least 4 noble sorcerers nearby, but 2 are easy to reach. Wait for the mercenary patrolling the road to ride by, then head across the road and left until you're climbing the slope. One sorcerer &amp; retinue will be coming down this slope from the camp above. After killing them, turn around, and there is another sorcerer &amp; retinue traveling down the road. You may want to wait for the mercenary to pass again, because he takes actual effort to fight (whereas the sorcerers have bad eyesight and go down quickly). Once you've killed and looted both groups, head back to the grace to rest, because it's a rare enough drop that it'll probably take you many resets to get. </li></ul>",

By the time you kill the last Cuckoo Knight you should have enough distance between you and the other mobs to go out of combat. If you start from the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace and kill the sitting Cuckoo Knight last, you'll have to either run back to the site of grace, kill all the surrounding mobs or use your Memory of Grace, since being in combat will prevent you from fast traveling.    Alternative route (click for image): Start in the Bellum Church and head east. While behind the ruin (Point 1), summon your spirit ash. Go around to the front, and immediately kill the caster standing on the ruin (just to make the fight less annoying). Kill the Cuckoo Knight&nbsp; and two other mobs (Point 2); while fighting, a farther mob will sound a horn. This will summon a horseback Knight. While fighting the horseback Knight, another will come around during their standard patrol. After these three have been killed, head south-west and then east to go up the hill to Point 3. A solo Knight will be here. After killing, refill on HP/FP and jump down the ruins and follow the path to Point 4. Summon your ashes again to fight the group on the road, including a Knight. While fighting this group, you may attract the attention of the Knight on the north-west side of the road. If not, head up to kill them, then cross the road to kill the final one. This path will net you 7 Cuckoo Knight kills in around 2 minutes.     </li></ul>",

Alternative route (click for image): Start in the Bellum Church and head east. While behind the ruin (Point 1), summon your spirit ash. Go around to the front, and immediately kill the caster standing on the ruin (just to make the fight less annoying). Kill the Cuckoo Knight&nbsp; and two other mobs (Point 2); while fighting, a farther mob will sound a horn. This will summon a horseback Knight. While fighting the horseback Knight, another will come around during their standard patrol. After these three have been killed, head south-west and then east to go up the hill to Point 3. A solo Knight will be here. After killing, refill on HP/FP and jump down the ruins and follow the path to Point 4. Summon your ashes again to fight the group on the road, including a Knight.

Going through the&nbsp;Gaol Cave is the intended route.   Credit to anonymous comment below for the following: I'll try and better explain what the writers meant by “precise jumps on the cliffs”. Go to the Third Church of Marika and face Southeast. Ride your horse until the cliff meets the water. The cliff side here should have a more red hue to it than the rest of the stone typically found in Limgrave. If you’re facing the wall due East you’ll notice a cragged vertical line where one part of the cliff face is protruding from another. Double jump on Torrent while following that and you should now be riding up the cliff face. Now turn your camera to face Northeast, you’ll notice what appears to be an arrowhead of grey stone forming a flat surface among the red-hued cliff. Jump there. Turn the camera South. While it doesn’t look feasible, sprint jump with torrent towards the protrusion across the before mentioned cragged vertical line. When you land, quickly double jump (facing East) to get on top of the ledge. You’ll notice above you several steps in the cliff face just slightly to the right- climb those. Then, jump due North onto the final platform. You will now be above the cliff and able to drop down.  </li></ul>",

Looted from a dead body in the courtyard with Iron Maidens near Fortified Manor, First Floor at Leyndell, Royal Capital.&nbsp;  Castle Sol: 1x&nbsp;found on a corpse on a wooden awning in the central building of the courtyard. To reach this, head north while hugging the western ramparts&nbsp;from the castle's Main Entrance. Look for a room inside the ramparts near the northern section. This room has several slimes and a ladder. Climb the ladder to get on top of the ramparts and follow it west to a wooden bridge that connects to the central building. Beware the spectral Exile&nbsp;enemies mounted on ballistae on the ramparts, as well as the central building. Once on the central building's roof, jump on top of the cluttered objects draped in cloth in the northeastern section so you can get over the wall onto the awning and collect the axe.

The northern one&nbsp;can&nbsp;be easily farmed by starting from the Castle Sol Rooftop site of grace and running south to the elevator. The Banished Knight can be shot with ranged weapons from here&nbsp;causing&nbsp;it to teleport to the player. The same can be achieved by shooting an arrow through the arrow slit in the grace platform (west side), although the knight doesn't always teleport when shooting him from this spot.  The southern one can be reached&nbsp;from the Church of the Eclipse site of grace by exiting&nbsp;through the church to the left, turning right outside, and heading up the ladder to the catwalks. After following the catwalk past the exile soldier and around the small tower, the Banished Knight can be found just past the ladder leading down. It is recommended that the player jump onto the lower roof next to the catwalk and tower, and bait the red-eyed Banished Knight into teleporting onto the small wooden catwalk extension of the roof; then the player can roll or jump to the walkway the Banished Knight was just standing on. The Banished Knight will slowly walk towards the player, then fall to its death onto the ground below, saving the player a good deal of trouble. Then the player walk down the walkway and make their way over to the loot, which will be in a corner, behind a tombstone. </li><li>  Dropped from&nbsp;all other&nbsp;Banished Knights.
